=======
Bot to remove spam on some (mostly NSFW) subreddits.

* Utilizes crowd-sourcing (via a select few trusted admins) to maintain an updated spam filter via a web UI.

* Enforces the spam filters instantly across all subreddits the bot moderates.

additional functions
====================
The bot has reverse-image-search capabilities (via http://i.rarchives.com).

Using reverse-image-search, the bot:
* Removes illicit content found to go against Reddit's guidelines,
* Removes reposts of /r/gonewild content not submitted by the original poster,

The bot also enforces specific rules within some subreddits (e.g. prevents duplicate threads from the same user in 1 week).
